-- An implementation of the <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/proposal/abstract-file-path Abstract FilePath Proposal>,
-- which aims to supersede @type FilePath = String@ for various reasons:
--
-- 1. it is more efficient and avoids memory fragmentation (uses unpinned 'ShortByteString' under the hood)
-- 2. it is more type-safe (newtype over 'ShortByteString')
-- 3. avoids round-tripping issues by not converting to String (which is not total and loses the encoding)
-- 4. abstracts over unix and windows while keeping the original bytes
--
-- It is important to know that filenames\/filepaths have different representations across platforms:
--
-- - On /Windows/, filepaths are expected to be encoded as UTF16-LE <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/76f10dd8-699d-45e6-a53c-5aefc586da20 as per the documentation>, but
--   may also include invalid surrogate pairs, in which case UCS-2 can be used. They are passed as @wchar_t*@ to syscalls.
--   'AbstractFilePath' only maintains the wide character invariant.
-- - On /Unix/, filepaths don't have a predefined encoding (although they
--   are often interpreted as UTF8) as per the
--   <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_170 POSIX specification>
--   and are passed as @char[]@ to syscalls. 'AbstractFilePath' maintains no invariant
--   here. Some functions however, such as 'toAbstractFilePathUtf', may expect
--   or produce UTF8.
--
-- Apart from encoding, filepaths have additional restrictions per platform:
--
-- - On /Windows/ the <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions naming convention> may apply
-- - On /Unix/, only @NUL@ bytes are disallowed as per the <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_170 POSIX specification>
--
-- Use 'isValid' to check for these restrictions ('AbstractFilePath' doesn't
-- maintain this invariant).
--
-- Also note that these restrictions are
-- not exhaustive and further filesystem specific restrictions may apply on
-- all platforms. This library makes no attempt at satisfying these.
-- Library users may need to account for that, depending
-- on what filesystems they want to support.
--
-- It is advised to follow these principles when dealing with filepaths\/filenames:
--
-- 1. Avoid interpreting filenames that the OS returns, unless absolutely necessary.
--    For example, the filepath separator is usually a predefined 'Word8', regardless of encoding.
--    So even if we need to split filepaths, it might still not be necessary to understand the encoding
--    of the filename.
-- 2. When interpreting OS returned filenames consider that these might not be UTF8 on /unix/
--    or at worst don't have an ASCII compatible encoding. Some strategies here involve looking
--    up the current locale and using that for decoding ('fromAbstractFilePathFS' does this).
--    Otherwise it can be reasonable to assume UTF8 on unix ('fromAbstractFilePathUtf' does that) if your application specifically
--    mentions that it requires a UTF8 compatible system. These things should be documented.
-- 3. When dealing with user input (e.g. on the command line) on /unix/ as e.g. @String@ the input
--    encoding is lost. The output encoding (e.g. how we write a filename to disk) can then
--    either follow the current locale again ('toAbstractFilePathFS') or a fixed encoding
--    ('toAbstractFilePathUtf'/'toAbstractFilePathEnc'). The decision should be clearly documented. If the input is in the
--    form of a @ByteString@, then 'System.AbstractFilePath.Internal.bytesToAFP' may be of interest, unless the input needs further
--    interpretation.
